    "  1. The entrance pupil transmission in black and white, and the phase ranging from red to blue to show the wavefront error. We include here a plausible estimate for wavefront error due to mirror polishing variations. (This is currently approximated by a map of high-frequency errors in the Hubble primary, since such data is not yet available for the WFIRST primary mirror.)\n",
    "  2. The same transmission and phase map with the addition of the phase term due to field-dependent optical aberrations and intermediate instrument optics. (Specifically, this is based on Zernike coefficients derived from the Cycle 5 optical modeling effort at GSFC.)\n",
    "  3. The final oversampled detector plane, with log-scaled intensity\n",
    "\n",
    "Below that, you will see a side-by-side comparison of the oversampled PSF, and the PSF binned down to detector pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, a button labeled \"Download FITS image from last calculation\" will appear below the \"Calculate PSF\" button. Click that to download the oversampled and detector-pixel-binned images as a multi-extension FITS file. (WebbPSF also offers tools to analyze PSFs within the notebook or your own scripts, which are described in the next section.)\n",

    "### Display Optical System\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows a 2 x 2 grid of plots. The left hand side shows transmission (e.g. pupil or mask shape), and the right side shows optical path difference (which is converted to phase across the pupil). The first row represents the pupil plane at the primary mirror, and the second row is the notional pupil plane after all the field dependent aberrations have been applied to the wavefront, but before the final propagation to a detector or image plane.\n",
